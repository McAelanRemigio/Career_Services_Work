This repository contains my internal analytics work for **San Diego State University Career Services**, where I focus on improving operational insights and data-driven decision-making.  

The R scripts reflect how we conduct analysis internally, while the Python files show how I practice translating those methods to maintain fluency across both languages.

For **privacy and confidentiality reasons**, all datasets, variable names, and identifiers have been **generalized or removed**.  
The code shared here is written to **mirror real workflows** while remaining reusable and adaptable so it can be used as a potential source of inspiration for similar analytical projects in other organizations.
